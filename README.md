## *Why*?

### Key Advantages
+ **Scalability**
+ **Speed**
+ **Compiled** and run on the **Erlang VM** ("BEAM"). [(Renowned for efficiency)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16779162/what-kind-of-virtual-machine-is-beam-the-erlang-vm)
+ Much better ["garbage collection"](http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/garbage-collection) than virtually any other VM
+ Many tiny processes (as opposed to "threads"
which are more difficult to manage)
+ **Functional** language with [dynamic](https://www.sitepoint.com/typing-versus-dynamic-typing/) typing
+ [Immutable data](https://benmccormick.org/2016/06/04/what-are-mutable-and-immutable-data-structures-2/) so ["state"](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/235558/what-is-state-mutable-state-and-immutable-state) is always **predictable**! <br />
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22413420/8a538bc2-e6af-11e6-80fd-209deb887820.png) <br />
+ **High reliability, availability and fault tolerance** (_because of Erlang_)
means apps built with elixir are run in production for **years**
without any "_downtime_"!
+ Real-time web apps are "_easy_"
(_or at least easier than many other languages!_) as **WebSockets & streaming** are baked-in

Things *will* go wrong with
code, and Elixir provides supervisors which describe how to restart parts of
your system when things don't go as planned.

## *What*?

[_"Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and
 maintainable applications."_](http://elixir-lang.org/)

### Video Introductions

If you have the time, these videos give a nice contextual introduction into what Elixir is, what it's used for and how it works:

<!-- note we should update this once we have
made our *own* intro to Elixir vid! -->

- Code School's [Try Elixir](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-elixir), 3 videos (25mins :movie_camera: plus exercises, totalling 90mins). The 'Try' course is free (there is an extended paid for course).
- Pete Broderick's [Intro to Elixir](https://youtu.be/lly-1UYmnFI) (41 mins :movie_camera:)
- Jessica Kerr's [Elixir Should Take Over the World](https://youtu.be/X25xOhntr6s) (58 mins :movie_camera:)

Not a video learner? Looking for a specific learning? https://elixirschool.com/ is an excellent, free, open-source resource that explains all things Elixir :book: :heart:.

## *How*?

Before you learn Elixir as a language you will need to have it installed on your machine.

To do so you can go to
http://elixir-lang.org/install.html or follow our guide here:

### Installation:

#### Mac:

`brew install elixir`

#### Ubuntu:

+ **Add the Erlang Solutions repo**:

```
wget https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb && sudo dpkg -i erlang-solutions_1.0_all.deb
```
+ **Run**: `sudo apt-get update`
+ **Install the Erlang/OTP platform and all of its applications**:
`sudo apt-get install esl-erlang`
+ **Install Elixir**: `sudo apt-get install elixir`

## Learn Elixir

## Commands

+ After installing Elixir you can open the interactive shell by typing `iex`.
This allows you to type in any elixir expression and see the result in the terminal.

+ Type in `h` followed by the `function` name at any time to see documentation information about any given built-in function and how to use it. E.g If you type `h round` into the (iex) terminal you should see
something like this:

![elixir-h](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14013616/20860273/fc801b14-b96b-11e6-9b17-7e26666d5d94.png)

+ Typing `i` followed by the value name will give you information about a value in your code:

![elixir-i](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14013616/20860322/3c01d984-b96d-11e6-8cc4-a46c8657f5b4.png)

## Basic Types

This section brings together the key information from Elixir's
[Getting Started](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/basic-types.html)
documentation and multiple other sources. It will take you through some examples to practice using and familiarise yourself with Elixir's 7 basic types.

Elixir's 7 basic types:

* `integers`
* `floats`
* `booleans`
* `atoms`
* `strings`
* `lists`
* `tuples`

### Numbers

Type `1 + 2` into the terminal (after opening `iex`):
```elixir
iex> 1 + 2
3
```

More examples:

```elixir
iex> 5 * 5
10
iex> 10 / 2
5.0

# When using the `/` with two integers this gives a `float` (5.0).
# If you want to do integer division or get the division remainder
# you can use the `div` or `rem` functions
iex> div(10, 2)
5
iex> div 10, 2
5
iex> rem 10, 3
1
```

### Booleans

Elixir supports `true` and `false` as booleans.

```elixir
iex> true
true
iex> false
false

iex> is_boolean(true)
true
iex> is_boolean(1)
false
```

### Atoms

Atoms are constants where their name is their own value
(some other languages call these Symbols).

```elixir
iex> :hello
:hello
iex> :hello == :world
false
```

`true` and `false` are actually atoms in Elixir

Names of _modules_ in Elixir are also atoms. `MyApp.MyModule`
is a valid atom, even if no such module has been declared yet.

```elixir
iex> is_atom(MyApp.MyModule)
true
```

Atoms are also used to reference modules from Erlang libraries,
including built-in ones.

```elixir
iex> :crypto.rand_bytes 3
<<23, 104, 108>>
```

One popular use of atoms in Elixir is to use them as messages
for [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching).
Let's say you have a function which processes an `http` request.
The outcome of this process is either going to be a success or an error.
You could therefore use atoms to indicate whether
or not this process is successful.

```elixir
def process(file) do
  lines = file |> split_lines

  case lines do
    nil ->
      {:error, "failed to process file"}
    lines ->
      {:ok, lines}
  end
end
```
Here we are saying that the method,
`process/1` will return a [tuple](#) response.
If the result of our process is successful, it will return `{:ok, lines}`,
however if it fails (e.g. returns nil) then it will return an error.
This will allows us to *pattern* match on this result.

```elixir
{:ok, lines} = process('text.txt')
```

Thus, we can be sure that we will always have the lines returned to us
and never a *nil* value (because it will throw an error).
This becomes extremely useful when piping multiple methods together.

### Strings

Strings are surrounded by double quotes.

```elixir
iex> "Hello World"
"Hello world"

# You can print a string using the `IO` module
iex> IO.puts "Hello world"
"Hello world"
:ok
```

### Lists

Elixir uses square brackets to make a list.

```elixir
iex> myList = [1,2,3]
iex> myList
[1,2,3]

iex> length(myList)
3

# concatenating lists together
iex> [1, 2, 3] ++ [4, 5, 6]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# removing items from a list
iex> [1, true, 2, false, 3, true] -- [true, false]
[1, 2, 3, true]
```

Lists are [enumerable](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/39) and can use the [Enum](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html)
module to perform iterative functions such as mapping.

### Tuples

Elixir uses curly brackets to make a tuple.

Tuples are similar to lists but are
[not suited to data sets that need to be updated or added to regularly](#lists-or-tuples).

```elixir
iex> tuple = {:ok, "hello"}
{:ok, "hello"}

# get element at index 1
iex> elem(tuple, 1)
"hello"

# get the size of the tuple
iex> tuple_size(tuple)
2
```

Tuples are [not enumerable](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/39) and there are far fewer functions available
in the [Tuple](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/v1.0/elixir/Tuple.html) module. You can reference tuple values by index but [you cannot iterate over them](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/39).
If you must treat your tuple as a list,
then convert it using `Tuple.to_list(your_tuple)`

### Lists or Tuples?

If you need to iterate over the values use a list.

When dealing with **large** lists or tuples:
+ `Updating` a `list` (adding or removing elements) is **fast**
+ `Updating` a `tuple` is **slow**


+ `Reading` a `list` (getting its length or selecting an element) is **slow**
+ `Reading` a `tuple` is **fast**

## Functions and Modules

### Anonymous functions

Anonymous functions start with `fn` and end with `end`.


```elixir
iex> add = fn a, b -> a + b end

iex> add.(1, 2)
3
```

Note a dot `.` between the variable `add` and parenthesis is required
to invoke an anonymous function.

In Elixir, functions are `first class citizens` meaning that they can
be passed as arguments to other functions the same way integers and strings can.

```elixir
iex> is_function(add)
true
```

This uses the inbuilt function `is_function` which checks to see if
the parameter passed is a function and returns a bool.

Anonymous functions are [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) (_named_ functions are not)
and as such they can access variables
that are in scope when the function is defined.
You can define a new anonymous function that uses the `add`
anonymous function we have previously defined:

```elixir
iex> double = fn a -> add.(a, a) end

iex> double.(5)
10
```

These functions can be useful but will no longer be available to you.
If you want to make something more permanent then you can create a `module`.

### Modules

With modules you're able to group several functions together.
Most of the time it is convenient to write modules into files
so they can be compiled and reused.

Get started by creating a file named `math.ex`,
open it in your text editor and add the following code

```elixir
defmodule Math do
  def sum(a, b) do
    a + b
  end
end
```
In order to create your own modules in Elixir, use the `defmodule` [macro](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+a+macro&*),
then use the `def` macro to define functions in that module.
So in this case the module is `Math` and the function is `sum`.

Once this is saved the file can be compiled by typing `elixirc`
into the terminal followed by the file name.
```
$ elixirc math.ex
```

This will generate a file named `Elixir.Math.beam` containing the bytecode
for the defined module. If we start `iex` again, our module definition
will be available (provided that `iex` is started
  in the same directory the bytecode file is in):

```elixir
iex> Math.sum(1, 2)
3
```


## Generating your first Elixir project

To get started with your first Elixir project you need to make use of the [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html) build tool that comes straight out of the box. Mix allows you to do a number of things including:

- Create projects
- Compile projects
- Run tasks
  - Testing
  - Generate documentation
- Manage dependencies

To generate a new project follow these steps:

#### Initialise a project by typing the following command in your terminal, replacing [project_name] with the name of your project:

```bash
> mix new [project_name]
```
We have chosen to call our project 'animals'

This will create a new folder with the given name of your project and should also print something that looks like this to the command line:

```bash
* creating README.md
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating config
* creating config/config.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/animals.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/animals_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd animals
    mix test

Run "mix help" for more commands.
```
Navigate to your newly created directory:

```bash
> cd animals
```
Open the directory in your text editor. You will be able to see that Elixir has
generated a few files for us that are specific to our project:

- `lib/animals.ex`
- `test/animals_test.ex`

#### Open up the `animals.ex` file in the lib directory. You should already see some `hello-world` boilerplate like this:

```elixir
defmodule Animals do
  @moduledoc """
  Documentation for Animals.
  """

  @doc """
  Hello world.

  ## Examples

      iex> Animals.hello
      :world

  """
  def hello do
    :world
  end
end
```
Elixir has created a module with the name of your project along with a function
that prints out a `:world` atom when called. It's also added boilerplate for
module and function documentation. (*we will go into more detail about
  documentation later*)

#### Let's test out the boilerplate code. In your project directory type the following command:
```bash
> iex -S mix
```
What this basically means is, "Start the elixir interactive terminal and compile
with the context of my current project". This allows you to access modules and
functions created within the file tree.  
Call the `hello-world` function given to us by Elixir. It should print out the
`:world` atom to the command line:
```bash
> Animals.hello
# :world
```

#### Let's start to create our own methods in the `Animals` module. Replace the `hello-world` method with the following:

```elixir
@doc """
create_zoo returns a list of zoo animals

## Examples

    iex> Animals.create_zoo
    ["lion", "tiger", "gorilla", "elephant", "monkey", "giraffe"]

"""
def create_zoo do
  ["lion", "tiger", "gorilla", "elephant", "monkey", "giraffe"]
end
```
To run our new code we will first have to recompile our `iex`. This can be done
by typing:  
```bash
> recompile()
```
Now we will have access to the `create_zoo` method. Try it out in the command line:
```bash
> Animals.create_zoo
# ["lion", "tiger", "gorilla", "elephant", "monkey", "giraffe"]
```

#### Let's extend the `Animals` module. Let's say that you're visiting the zoo but you can't decide which order to view the animals. We can create a `randomise` function that takes a list of animals and returns a new list with a random order:

```elixir
@doc """
randomise takes a list of zoo animals and returns a new randomised list with
the same elements as the first.

## Examples

    iex> zoo = Animals.create_zoo
    iex> Animals.randomise(zoo)
    ["monkey", "tiger", "elephant", "gorilla", "giraffe", "lion"]

"""
def randomise(zoo) do
  Enum.shuffle(zoo)
end
```
Note we are making use of a pre-built module called `Enum` which has a list of
methods that you can use on enumerables such as lists. Documentation for `Enum`
methods can be found [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Enum.html)

#### Let's add another method to the `Animals` module. Let's say that we want to find out if our zoo contains an animal:

```elixir
@doc """
contains? takes a list of zoo animals and a single animal and returns a boolean
as to whether or not the list contains the given animal.

## Examples

    iex> zoo = Animals.create_zoo
    iex> Animals.contains?(zoo, "gorilla")
    true
"""
def contains?(zoo, animal) do
  Enum.member?(zoo, animal)
end
```
**NOTE:** It's convention when writing a function that returns a boolean to add a question
mark after the name of the method.

#### Pattern matching example: Let's create a function that takes a list of animals and the number of animals that you'd like to see and then returns a list of animals.

```elixir
@doc """
see_animals takes a list of zoo animals and the number of animals that
you want to see and then returns a list

## Examples

    iex> zoo = Animals.create_zoo
    iex> Animals.see_animals(zoo, 2)
    ["monkey", "giraffe"]
"""
def see_animals(zoo, count) do
  # Enum.split returns a tuple so we have to pattern match on the result
  # to get the value we want out
  {_seen, to_see} = Enum.split(zoo, -count)
  to_see
end
```

#### What if we want to save our list of animals to a file? Let's write a function that will do this for us:

```elixir
@doc """
save takes a list of zoo animals and a filename and saves the list to that file

## Examples

    iex> zoo = Animals.create_zoo
    iex> Animals.save(zoo, "my_animals")
    :ok
"""
def save(zoo, filename) do
  # erlang is converting the zoo list to something that can be written to the
  # file system
  binary = :erlang.term_to_binary(zoo)
  File.write(filename, binary)
end
```

In your command line run the following:

```bash
> zoo = Animals.create_zoo
> Animals.save(zoo, "my_animals")
```
This will create a new file in your file tree with the name of the file that
you specified in the function. It will contain some odd characters for example this
is what gets returned for our animals file:

�l\\&#0;&#0;&#0;&#6;m&#0;&#0;&#0;&#4;lionm&#0;&#0;&#0;&#5;tigerm&#0;&#0;&#0;&#7;gorillam&#0;&#0;&#0;&#8;elephantm&#0;&#0;&#0;&#6;monkeym&#0;&#0;&#0;&#7;giraffej

#### Now let's write a function that will allow us to access that information again:

```elixir
@doc """
load takes filename and returns a list of animals if the file exists

## Examples

    iex> Animals.load("my_animals")
    ["lion", "tiger", "gorilla", "elephant", "monkey", "giraffe"]
    iex> Animals.load("aglkjhdfg")
    "File does not exist"

"""
def load(filename) do
  # here we are running a case expression on the result of File.read(filename)
  # if we receive an :ok then we want to return the list
  # if we receive an error then we want to give the user an error-friendly message
  case File.read(filename) do
    {:ok, binary} -> :erlang.binary_to_term(binary)
    {:error, _reason} -> "File does not exist"
  end
end
```

#### Pipe Operator

What if we wanted to call some of our functions in succession to another? Let's create a function that creates a zoo, randomises it and then returns a selected number of animals to go and see:

```elixir
@doc """
selection takes a number, creates a zoo, randomises it and then returns a list
of animals of length selected

## Examples

    iex> Animals.selection(2)
    ["gorilla", "giraffe"]

"""
def selection(number_of_animals) do
  # We are using the pipe operator here. It takes the value returned from
  # the expression and passes it down as the first argument in the expression
  # below. see_animals takes two arguments but only one needs to be specified
  # as the first is provided by the pipe operator
  Animals.create_zoo
  |> Animals.randomise
  |> Animals.see_animals(number_of_animals)
end
```

Now that we have the functionality for our module, let's take a look at the documentation
that we have written and how we can maximise its use.



## Documentation

When we created a new project with mix, it created a file for us called `mix.exs`
which is referred to as the 'MixFile'. This file holds information about our
project and its dependencies.

At the bottom of the file it gives us a function called `deps` which manages all
of the dependencies in our project. To install a third party package we need to
manually write it in the deps function (*accepts a tuple of the package name and
the version*) and then install it in the command line. Let's install `ex_doc` as
an example:

Add the following to the deps function in your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:ex_doc, "~> 0.12"}
  ]
end
```

Then in the command line quit your `iex` shell and enter the following to install
the `ex_docs` dependency:

```bash
> mix deps.get
```

You might receive an error saying: `Could not find Hex, which is needed to build dependency :ex_doc
Shall I install Hex? (if running non-interactively, use: "mix local.hex --force") [Yn]`.
If you do then just enter `y` and then press enter. This will install the
dependencies that you need.

Once `ex_docs` has been installed then run the following command to generate
documentation (*make sure you're not in `iex`*):

```bash
> mix docs
```

This will generate documentation that can be viewed if you copy the file path of
the `index.html` file within the newly created `doc` folder and then paste it in
your browser. If you have added documentation to your module and functions as per
the examples above, you should see something like the following:

![api](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/22835012/260b07f4-efaf-11e6-9704-690c6c245c37.png)

It looks exactly like the format of the official Elixir docs because they used the
same tool to create theirs. Here is what the method documentation should look like
if you click on `Animals`:

![doc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/22835092/763c66c8-efaf-11e6-8428-3c2650c64eb8.png)
![functions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/22835113/8607cd72-efaf-11e6-9850-1c7885416b2e.png)

This is an incredibly powerful tool that comes baked-in with elixir. It means that
other developers who are joining the project can be brought up to speed incredibly
quickly!



## Testing

When you generate a project with Elixir it automatically gives you a number of
files and directories. One of these directories is called `test` and it holds two
files like should have names like:
- `[project_name]_test.exs`
- `test_helper.exs`

Our first file was called `animals_test.exs` and it contained some boilerplate that
looks like:

```elixir
defmodule AnimalsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case
  doctest Animals

  test "the truth" do
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
  end
end
```
**NOTE:** It automatically includes a line called `doctest Animals`. What this means
is that it can run tests from the examples in the documentation that you write for
your functions

To run the tests enter the following in your terminal:
`mix test`  
It should print out whether the tests pass or fail.

Let's add some tests of our own. Firstly let's write a test for the `Animals.randomise`
function. The reason why we wouldn't want to write a doctest for this is because
the output value changes everytime you call it. Here's how we would write a test
for that type of function:

In the `animals_test.exs` file, remove the boilerplate "the truth" test and then
add this:

```elixir
test "randomise" do
  zoo = Animals.create_zoo
  assert zoo != Animals.randomise(zoo)
end
```

**NOTE:** you do not need to install and require any external testing frameworks.
It all comes with the Elixir package. Simply write `test` followed by a string
representing what you are trying to test and then write your assertion.

The test above isn't completely air-tight. Elixir provides you with assertions that
can help deal with things like this. The test could be re-written like so:

```elixir
test "randomise" do
  zoo = Animals.create_zoo
  refute zoo == Animals.randomise(zoo)
end
```

This is basically saying "prove to be false that zoo is equal to Animals.randomise(zoo)"


## Data Structures

### Maps
Maps are very similar to Object literals in JavaScript. They have almost the same
syntax except for a `%` sign. They look like this:

```elixir
animal = %{
  name: "Rex",
  type: "dog",
  legs: 4
}
```
Values can be accessed in a couple of ways. The first is by dot notation just
like JavaScript:

```elixir
name = animal.name
# Rex
```
The second way values can be accessed is by pattern matching. Let's say we wanted
to assign values to variables for each of the key-value pairs in the map. We
would write something that looks like this:

```elixir
iex> %{
  name: name,
  type: type,
  legs: legs
} = animal
# we now have access to the values by typing the variable names
iex> name
# "Rex"
iex> type
# "dog"
iex> legs
# 4
```
#### Updating a value inside a map
Due to the immutability of Elixir, you cannot update a map using dot notation for
example:

```elixir
iex> animal = %{
  name: "Rex",
  type: "dog",
  legs: 4
}
iex> animal.name = "Max" # this cannot be done!
```
In Elixir we can only create new data structures as opposed to manipulating existing
ones. So when we *update* a map, we are creating a new map with our new values.
This can be done in a couple of ways:

- Function
- Syntax

1. Using a function  
We can update a map using `Map.put(map, key, value)`. This takes the map you want
to update followed by the key we want to reassign and lastly the value that we want
to reassign to the key:
```elixir
iex> updatedAnimal = Map.put(animal, :name, "Max")
iex> updatedAnimal
# %{legs: 4, name: "Max", type: "dog"}
```

2. Using syntax  
We can use a special syntax for updating a map in Elixir. It looks like this:
```elixir
iex> %{animals | name: "Max"}
# %{legs: 4, name: "Max", type: "dog"}
```
**NOTE:** Unlike the function method above, this syntax can only be used to UPDATE
a current key-value pair inside the map, it cannot add a new key value pair.

## tl;dr

> ***Note***: this is _definately **not**_ a "_reason_" to switch programming
languages, but _one_ of our (_totally unscientific_) reasons for deciding
to _investigate_ other options for programming languages was the fact
that JavaScript (_with the introduction of ES2015_) now has
***Six Ways to Declare a Function***:
https://rainsoft.io/6-ways-to-declare-javascript-functions/
which means that there is _ambiguity_ and "_debate_" as to which is
"_best practice_", Go, Elixir and Rust don't suffer from this problem.
Sure there are "_anonymous_" functions in Elixir
(_required for functional programming_!) but there are still only ***Two Ways***
to define a `function` (_and both have specific use-cases_),
which is _way_ easier to explain to a _beginner_ than the JS approach.

+ [The Complete Phoenix and Elixir Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial/)
on udemy is a great video series for learning and reinforcing the basics of
Elixir. The Elixir sections (1-6) are really useful, but for Phoenix it may
be better to start with our
[learn-phoenix-framework](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework)
repo as the udemy tutorial uses an older version of Phoenix
+ While Elixir by _itself_ is pretty _amazing_,
where the language really shines is in the **Phoenix Web Framework**!!
So once you know the basics of the language [try learning Phoenix](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-web-development).
