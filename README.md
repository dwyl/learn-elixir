# Learn some Elixir with Livebook

> this is still WIP!

You have 3 ways to enjoy this Livebook

## 1. Run it locally

- If you have `Livebook` already installed, this is the best experience as you will use a more powerful computer (yours 🥳). Just click on the button below (or fork and run it):

[![Run in Livebook](https://livebook.dev/badge/v1/blue.svg)](https://livebook.dev/run?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdwyl%2Flearn-elixir-with-livebook%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Flearn-elixir-on-livebook.livemd)

- If you have `Docker` installed, no need to install `Elixir` or `Livebook`. Launch `Docker` and run the `Livebook` image:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 --pull always -e LIVEBOOK_PASSWORD="securesecret" livebook/livebook
```

Open the browser, navigate to `localhost:8080`, enter the password "securesecret", and upload the file:

**[learn-elixir-on-livebook.livemd]**

or paste [this URL](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir-with-livebook/blob/main/learn-elixir-on-livebook.livemd) from this repo and you are done.

## 2. Run it the cloud

If you don't have `Elixir` nor `Livebook` installed, you can still run this `Livebook`. 


You (**right**-)click on the grey button **"Run in Livebook"** below. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark: You **right-click"** to keep this reminder page open 😉 because you will need to remember to do 2 things:
  -  firstly, look at the bottom for the link "see source" as showed below, 🤔, and click.

  -  and finally, select the file [dwyl-learn-elixir.livemd]. It should be printed in green, and "join session". 🤗
   

Happy learning! 🥳
